**📌 Overview**

ASHA-Saathi is a digital platform designed to support ASHA workers in rural India.
ASHA workers are responsible for maternal health, child care, disease monitoring, and awareness, but they face problems like heavy workload, low pay transparency, safety issues, and poor digital tools.
This project aims to make their work easier, safer, and more effective using mobile technology and Google Cloud.
